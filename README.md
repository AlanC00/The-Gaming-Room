The Gaming Room Web Application

Project Overview:

Welcome to the documentation for the development of The Gaming Room's web-based game, Draw It or Lose It, brought to you by Creative Technology Solutions. My aim is to seamlessly bring the gaming experience to various platforms, allowing users to play Draw It or Lose It across devices through a web-based environment.

Client and Software Requirements
Client: The Gaming Room

Software Requirements:
Cross-Platform Compatibility
Team-Based Gameplay: Support for multiple teams.
Name Uniqueness: Ensure uniqueness of team and player names during creation.

System Architecture View:
Detailed UML class diagrams illustrate clear relationships and structures, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

Design Constraints: Unique identifiers, memory management, and design patterns (singleton and iterator) were incorporated for efficient code structure.
Cross-Platform Recommendations: Web-based deployment, cloud-based storage, and microservices architecture for seamless scalability.

Design Process Insights
The design document provided a solid foundation for the coding process.

Platform Considerations: 
Choosing the right operating platform (Mac, Linux, Windows) based on development costs, time, and expertise.
Client-Side Considerations: Tailoring the user experience for Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile devices.

Areas for Revision
If there's one aspect to revise, it would be further simplification of client-side considerations for improved clarity.

Cross-Platform Accessibility:
Ensuring users can enjoy the game seamlessly across devices.

Memory Management: Efficient coding to accommodate a potentially large user base.

Security: Utilizing web-based platforms with robust security features to protect user information.

Future Design Strategies
For future software applications, the following strategies will be employed:
